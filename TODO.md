# TODO List for Modular Trading System on MetaTrader 5

This TODO list is derived from the comprehensive roadmap for building a modular, robust trading system integrated with MetaTrader 5. It is organized by phases, with each item representing a specific actionable task.

## Phase 1: Architecture and Integration

- [ ] Choose and set up MT5 bridge technology (ZeroMQ, Python API)
- [ ] Build/test sample data requests and order placement from Python
- [ ] Validate data compatibility (OHLCV, depth, timestamps)

## Phase 2: Data Foundation

- [ ] Acquire full data history for selected assets (5+ years, tick/minute/daily); upload to data lake
- [ ] Create Python/Pandas scripts for cleaning, normalization, outlier removal
- [ ] Develop and test missing value imputation logic

## Phase 3: Feature Engineering

- [ ] Implement TA-Lib and custom technical indicator functions in pipeline
- [ ] Generate rolling/lags/statistics features; document each transformation
- [ ] Add feature selection step (variance, mutual information, correlation)

## Phase 4: Model Development

- [ ] Prepare data splits for walk-forward cross-validation
- [ ] Build, optimize, and document LSTM and Transformer models on features
- [ ] Log all parameters and validation metrics for each run
- [ ] Prototype and evaluate ensemble (bagging, stacking, meta-learning)

## Phase 5: Risk and Portfolio Controls

- [ ] Write and test dynamic position sizing logic (volatility/ATR-based)
- [ ] Implement stop-loss, take-profit, and pause-trading modules in execution loop
- [ ] Develop portfolio optimizer with CVXPY (add constraints/risk measures)
- [ ] Run Monte Carlo and stress tests on simulated portfolios

## Phase 6: Backtesting and Validation

- [ ] Integrate with Backtrader or preferred backtesting engine; connect to data feed
- [ ] Validate backtest output—cross-check with walk-forward and out-of-sample data
- [ ] Test with realistic costs, spreads, and slippage
- [ ] Save and review trade logs, equity curves, drawdowns, and error traces

## Phase 7: Visualization, Reporting, and Monitoring

- [ ] Set up QuantStats, Plotly, and Matplotlib dashboards for model/trade performance
- [ ] Build real-time or batch reporting scripts (daily/weekly/monthly)
- [ ] Configure live alerts for drawdown, error, and performance anomalies

## Phase 8: Documentation and Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Document each pipeline stage with README, diagrams, sample configs
- [ ] Set up version control, changelogs, and audit logs
- [ ] Assign peer review of both code and documentation changes
- [ ] Routinely revisit best practices—review system periodically for overfitting/drift
- [ ] Schedule regular performance reviews and team learning sessions

## General Best Practices

- [ ] Prioritize robustness and consistent performance across market regimes
- [ ] Design modules as loosely coupled, exchangeable components
- [ ] Maintain in-depth documentation and full audit trails
- [ ] Integrate regular, automated testing and walk-forward validation
- [ ] Build safety nets at every layer (code assertions, risk limits, circuit breakers)
- [ ] Ensure compliance with regulatory, tax, and internal policy requirements

## Notes

- Mark items as completed by changing [ ] to [x]
- Update this list as the project progresses and new tasks are identified
- Review and adapt based on emerging best practices and market changes
